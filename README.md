# How to Run

## Importing and Running an Android Project in Android Studio

## 1. Open Android Studio:

Ensure that you have Android Studio installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the [official Android Studio website](https://developer.android.com/studio).

### 2. Open an Existing Project:

- Open Android Studio.
- Click on "Open an existing Android Studio project" from the welcome screen.
- Navigate to the location to this Android Project folder. Click "OK."

### 3. Gradle Sync:

Once you open the project, Android Studio will start syncing the project with Gradle. This process may take a few moments.

### 4. Configure SDK and Dependencies:

Ensure that your project is configured with the correct Android SDK version and that all dependencies are resolved. Android Studio will usually prompt you to install missing components or update existing ones.

### 5. Run the Project:

- After the Gradle sync is complete, you should be able to see the project structure in the "Project" pane.
- Click the green "Run" button in the toolbar, or go to "Run" > "Run 'app'" from the top menu.

### 6. Choose a Deployment Target:

Android Studio will prompt you to choose a deployment target. This can be a physical device connected to your computer or an emulator. Ensure that the selected device has the necessary API level installed.

### 7. Build and Launch:

Android Studio will build the project and launch the app on the selected device. You should see the app running on your emulator or physical device.
